## What is here

The demo [IHaskell](https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell) (through [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)) notebook, and generated static HTML, for the [March 2015 meeting](http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Code-Supply/events/220880859/) of [Pittsburgh Haskell](http://PittsburghHaskell.org/).

The static version can also be viewed automatically rendered from source at the `nbviewer` site [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/pittsburgh-haskell/ihaskell-demo/blob/master/PittsburghHaskellDemo.ipynb).

## Running the notebook live yourself

A full installation of IHaskell including all the displays as of March 5, 2015 for GHC 7.8.4 was used.

Additional libraries required:

- `asciidiagram`
- `fgl`
- `graphviz`

A drawback of using IHaskell is lack of dependency or version information about the environment in which the notebook was successfully executed.
