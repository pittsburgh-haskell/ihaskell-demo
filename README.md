## What is here

The demo [IHaskell](https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell) (through [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)) notebook, and generated static HTML, for the [March 2015 meeting](http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Code-Supply/events/220880859/) of [Pittsburgh Haskell](http://PittsburghHaskell.org/).

The static version can also be viewed automatically rendered from source at the `nbviewer` site [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/pittsburgh-haskell/ihaskell-demo/blob/master/PittsburghHaskellDemo.ipynb).

## Running the notebook live yourself

The full installation of IHaskell as of March 7, 2015 was used.

In addition, the [`asciidiagram`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/asciidiagram) package was installed.
